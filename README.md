Project description:The academic
achievements of students and the students who drop out are both assessed
with respective multiclass target variable (dropout, graduate, enrolled) in
this study. In this analysis, the machine learning approach is deployed on
the dataset to build an effective framework for this domainThe
outcome of this research provides credence to the usefulness of using prediction modelling in universities and colleges, wherein policymakers have
access to such models for the purposes of budgeting and maximizing how
limited resources are distributed within the organizations. Finally, the outcome of this analysis is functional and can utilized in educational domain
for getting the positive results.

Up to now, the repository only includes the Jupyter notebook for data analysis and pre-processing. The dataset was not included to avoid intellectual property issues and to avoid uploading/downloading big amounts of information. The next section describes how the dataset can be downloaded from the  students’ educational achievement and dropouts using the supervised learning methods
